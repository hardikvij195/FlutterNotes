Connect Firebase Crashlytics -> Android / iOS -> Flutter 

Don't Upload ANY dYSM File as it is automatically done when an error comes
just follow these steps and check on with throw Exception on ios simulator 


firebase login

dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

flutterfire configure

flutter pub add firebase_core

flutterfire configure

await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);


If ->  This error comes -> 

Warning: Pub installs executables into ~/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):

  export PATH="$PATH":"~/.pub-cache/bin"
  
Then just copy paste this line in same vscode terminal 
  export PATH="$PATH":"~/.pub-cache/bin"
 


flutter pub add firebase_crashlytics


void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();


	await Firebase.initializeApp(
	options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
	);

 
  // Pass all uncaught errors from the framework to Crashlytics.
  FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterFatalError;

  runApp(MyApp());
}


TextButton(
    onPressed: () => throw Exception(),
    child: const Text("Throw Test Exception"),
),
